Botphal IRC bot is the official pet of The Ophal Project.

Created by @wolfmitchell.

The IRC library is NOT created by me and I am in no way related to the development of that library. Link to the library's code on github: https://github.com/JakobOvrum/LuaIRC

See +list for a list of commands. +kill only works if the bot is oper'd up on the server.
